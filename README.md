# Dog-Glossary-JavaScript
Made as a project within the Hyperskill.org platform.

Main focus on this project has been DOM manipulation as well as the Fetch API in JavaScript. As a vistitor of the website you can get a random picture of dog along with a few other things.

Huge credits to https://dog.ceo for their API, making this project possible.
